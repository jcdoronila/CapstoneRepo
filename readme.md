###### Reminder
Everytime we do something in the A-Team Fitness System, we usually increment our version control depending on what scale we've progress.

##### Example
`Version a.b.c.d`

`a` - when we do **major revisions** (change of template, giant database design change, etc.)

`b` - when we do **required revisions** (all major rev's are required, but not all required rev's are major)

`c` - when we **fix** the _bugs_ or unpolished parts of the preceding version 

`d` - when we do something **minor**, and is progressive for the system
